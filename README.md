# AlphaStar.

[AlphaStar](https://github.com/deepmind/alphastar) is a package from
[DeepMind](http://deepmind.com) that provides the tools to train an agent to
master StarCraft II offered by [Blizzard Entertainment](http://blizzard.com).

As part of our open-sourcing efforts to drive more research interest around
StarCraft II, we provide the following key offerings with this package:

1.  General purpose architectures to train StarCraftII agents in
    `architectures/` that can be used with different learning algorithms in
    online and offline settings.

2.  Data readers, offline training and evaluation scripts for fully offline
    reinforcement learning with Behavior Cloning as a representative example
    under `unplugged/` directory.

## Setup

We have tested AlphaStar only in **Python3.9** and **Linux**. Currently, we do
not support other operating systems and recommend users to stick to Linux.
The supported StarCraft game version for reproducibility is 
[4.9.2](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#downloads)

### Preliminaries

We recommend using a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies. This
should help to avoid version conflicts and just generally make the installation
process easier.

```shell
python3 -m venv alphastar
source alphastar/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

AlphaStar depends on [PySC2](https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2) converters for
data generation and evaluation. Since the code for converters is written in C++,
any changes to the converter code will require recompiling the PySC2 native
extensions. Because of this we offer two different ways to use AlphaStar:

1.  **Installing AlphaStar with `pip`**: this option requires the least setup.
    However if you make changes to PySC2, or if you want to use a version for
    which no pre-built wheel is available, you will need to manually build and
    install a new wheel for PySC2.
2.  **Building AlphaStar using Bazel**: in this case AlphaStar and PySC2 are
    built together from source. By default the PySC2 sources are fetched
    from GitHub. If you wish to use a local repository instead (e.g. because you
    have made local modifications to PySC2) you should modify
    `alphastar/WORKSPACE` as described in the comments.

#### Installing with `pip`

If you're interested in running the bleeding edge versions, you can do so by
cloning our GitHub repository and then executing the following command from the
main directory (where `setup.py` is located):

```
pip install -e .  # For an editable version
pip install .     # For a non-editable version
```

Note that this will also install all the dependencies of AlphaStar.

### Building with Bazel

First, install Bazel by following the instructions
[here](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/install-ubuntu.html).

PySC2 requires C++ 17, so Bazel builds of AlphaStar + PySC2 must use
`--cxxopt='-std=c++17'`. For example, to build all AlphaStar targets, run the
following command from the workspace root:

```shell
bazel build --cxxopt='-std=c++17' ...
```

To recursively run all of the tests within the `architectures/` subdirectory:

```shell
bazel test --cxxopt='-std=c++17' architectures/...
```

See the documentation for
[AlphaStar Unplugged](https://github.com/deepmind/alphastar/blob/master/alphastar/unplugged/README.md)
for example `run` commands.

Note: Bazel caches Python package dependencies downloaded from `pip`. To clear
this cache (for example if you have edited `requirements.txt`), run `bazel clean
--expunge`.

You may wish to use a
[.bazelrc file](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/guide.html#bazelrc-the-bazel-configuration-file)
to avoid the need to repeatedly specify command-line options, for instance
`--cxxopt='-std=c++17'`.

## Quickstart

For quickstart instructions on how to run training and evaluation scripts in
*fully offline* settings, please refer to
[this README](https://github.com/deepmind/alphastar/blob/master/alphastar/unplugged/README.md). In
this repository, we have not provided any online RL training code. But, the
architectures are fit to be used in both online and offline training.
